# CODSOFT_TASK_2_MOVIE_RATING_PREDICTION

During my CodSoft internship, I had the opportunity to work on a challenging and rewarding data science project – Movie Rating Prediction! 
Use this dataset to build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics.
